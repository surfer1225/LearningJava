## Tips for Algorithm Question

#### Step 1
- seek all possible clarifications, look for clues within those clarification

#### Step 2
- draw an example, and work out the solution for this particular case
- are certain corner cases included
- 0, null, sorted, negative, duplicates etc.

#### Step 3
- think about brute-force solution
- while walking through your algorithm, think about shortcuts
- look for unnecessary steps

#### Step 4
- think about different ways to represent the data
- do not code until you know exactly what you want to do

#### Step 5
- implement the solution
- never forget to modularize

#### Step 6
- walk through a super small test case
